# Why this repo exists

This repo serves as a way to hold my answer to the third trial on the Gophercises website. I will continue to attempt other excercises and upload my answers on this github page as I learn both git and golang.
## JSONStory

This golang document will read custom stories from a JSON document and then allow the user to select their options for how the story will unfold. The user can select whether to do this through command line or a web app.

### Running
In order to run this program from a terminal, enter the following command: go run *.go -Command_Line = [Boolean], where boolean is whether the user wishes to run the program from the command line. If the webapp version is selected, navigate to port 8080 of your local host.
